I have tried to built a platform that would help students and teachers facilitate the learning process by providing a series of tools that would engage students and boost their productivity. Given the times that we are facing, online learning has become a challenge for both students and teachers. Keeping that in mind, i built a platform that could ease the teaching and learning process.
The web portal primarily consists of 4 sections as explained below.

## Sections
* <b>Online Forum :</b> for students to connect with each other, discuss queries, solve doubts, etc.
* <b>Notes Maintainence Section</b> where students can create and maintain notes
* <b>Submission Tool</b> A portal for both students and teachers to connect, share resources, notes ans assignments, etc.
* <b>Mental Health/Recreation Corner</b> A section for students to take care of their mental health. As we know that pandemic has been tough for us and it has become dificult for students to take care of their mental well being, as it might get overwhelming for them. A curated list of apps, aticles, books, orgainsations, podcasts and talks for them to refer.
